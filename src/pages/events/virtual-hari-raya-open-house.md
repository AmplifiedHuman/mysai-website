Missing something celebrating Hari Raya away from home? Well, MYSAI X BPI has got your back! 

We will be hosting our first event together, a Hari Raya Get Together! Raya is all about getting together, meeting new people, and having fun!

From music performances, games, a little story telling and chat session or crying to Raya ads together, we will make sure everyone has fun! Mark your calendars and join us to meet the community in Ireland, you will never lose out making friends!

Remember the Hari Raya Photo competition where you stand a chance to win €50? We will be announcing the winners in the event and you will be able to see the creative pictures taken by the students! Not to mention there will be surprise cash prizes in the middle of the session and keep an eye on our social media accounts to find out who is performing!

What are you waiting for? Company, music, fun, chats, there is nothing more you can ask for! Sign up using the link above!
