Coming up on our second series of our discussion space, why not join us on a fun ‘Would you Rather’ to spice up your summer holidays?

‘Would you Rather’ is always that iconic game that just allows you to get to know a person better. Like peeling an onion, each layer you peel reveals a person’s personality. From what they value most, time or money, freedom or being silent, visiting the future or revisiting the past, or even whether someone prefers salt over sugar. You would think these closed-ended questions are just simple choices to pick, but when it comes to it, you realise it’s much more complex. Philosophical, weird, funny, or disgusting choices, each individual’s decision just makes you wonder, why?
