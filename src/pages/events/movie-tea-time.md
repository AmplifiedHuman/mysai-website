Summer break is finally here!! After a long and exhausting study year filled with exams and exciting events organised by us, it's time for us to really take some rest and enjoy some bonding sessions together.

What do you think? Let's have some chill amongst ourselves and enjoy a fun and relaxing movie of ‘La La Land’ together with Malaysian students across Ireland on 30th May from 2pm to 4pm.

All MYSAI’s committee and members are invited to this exclusive event! Since all of us have been busy with assignments and worrying about the current situation, take this chance to relax and enjoy in addition to making new friends. Bond over the movie and treat yourself to a relaxing time.

Hopefully, by the end of this event, MYSAI committee and members are able to build a stronger bond and make memorable memories with one another. The movie was selected based upon majority votes from members so since so many individuals are looking forward to it, come and see for yourself what is so great about this movie!

Do remember to prepare your popcorn, snacks and drinks before entering the “free cinema” with us! Hope to see you there! For now, take care and stay safe!
