This is our monthly event where our MYSAI members can discuss with each other about any topics (including sensitive ones) in a welcoming and safe space where validation and judgement is pushed aside. Each session lasts around 2 hours from 9.00am-11.00am with only 16 people maximum can join in so that each person can voice out their opinions either good, bad or even a neutral perspective about it. The objective of this event is to provide a safe platform for students to express their perspectives being themselves and also engaging with other students across Ireland.

Below are some topics that we had discussed in the past and in every session there is always an insightful experience to gain from;

* Body Positivity
* Gender Equality
* Is being vulnerable important
* Covid-19 spread
* Israel and Palestinian conflict

This session is facilitated by Donal Crotty. He is an experienced mentor and life coach who helped 5 companies and 50+ individuals to sort out problems, unravel meaningful values inside each person and encourage positive mindset to apply in our daily lives. Even in each session he would show a great mindset on how things are in a certain way and there is always something that we can change and if we can’t, that is also fine!

This is an example of our monthly session where each person will get the spotlight to voice out their opinions and Donal or other members would jump in as well. We will add student’s feedbacks here soon :)
