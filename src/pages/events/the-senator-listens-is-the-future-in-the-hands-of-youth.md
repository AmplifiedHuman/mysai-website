Politics – hate it or love it, it’s relevant to **every single one** of us. Many of us might feel that we are powerless to make a change, but we want you to know that it’s far from the truth. In collaboration with Badan Perhubungan Ireland (BPI) and Persatuan Pelajar Islam Malaysia Ireland (PPIMI) we have organised an event with the aim of empowering students’ voice in the political world.

The topic of the event will be focusing on _“In what ways could youths contribute to nation building?”_ and the objective of the talk is that by the end of the session, students will be better equip in practical and effective methods to be involved in serving Malaysian community in terms of political and welfare involvement.
