MYSAI has recently held an Irish Grad Meet-Up this summer. We had the honour to have MYSAI grad students speakers on board with us, sharing experiences and thoughts, answering the questions our fellows have about studying in Ireland.

MYSAI aimed to provide Malaysian students with the knowledge of recruitment processes, working life experiences, and how graduates should prepare for the potential challenges they will face in the post-pandemic working world. The session also provides networking opportunities for both the students and graduates. With consent given from both parties, social media accounts were shared between the two to establish a long term connection between Malaysian Irish Network and Malaysian Student Association of Ireland.

During the event, we had 6 different breakout rooms which hold students from the academic backgrounds of Computer Science, Medical, Engineering, Business, Masters and Undergraduates respectively. After collecting feedback from graduates and students, we are glad to say that the graduates, post graduates, and prospective students from Malaysia had a great time during the session and the students have found the session extremely helpful to their career planning.
