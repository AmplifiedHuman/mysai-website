Have you ever had a thought or an opinion you wanted to discuss or just wanted to find someone relatable? MYSAI will be launching a monthly "Discussion Space", a safe, free, fair environment for students to bring up issues or thoughts that one would wish to share or discuss.

Whether it’s about racism experiences, the teaching methods in Ireland, gender equality or even is Penang food or KL food better? Any topic that you can think of will stand a chance to be the next chosen topic for our session!

To establish a secure environment for all, students joining our sessions will have to go by our principle,

> "What happens in the Space, stays in the Space."

Mutual respect and privacy are our main priority for all.

Through this event, we aim to allow student to create a stronger bond, widen one’s horizon and develop a different perspective or better understanding of something. A "Space" to let your guard down, share an opinion you never voiced, or just to bring up something or even anything small that has been bugging your mind!

For this month, our chosen topic is "Is Penang food or KL food better?".

Mark your calendars and stay tuned for the upcoming topic! We wish to see you then! For now, good luck with finals!
