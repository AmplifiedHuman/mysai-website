Moving to Ireland can be an exhilarating and scary experience for a lot of new students, so we included some useful tips and information below so you can feel at ease in Ireland as soon as possible. This blog post will be updated frequently, so feel free to let us know if there are things that we missed!

### **Packing List**

When moving to a new country, it's usually not realistic to carry all of your belongings with you. Without a going abroad packing guide, deciding what to abandon and what to pack can be a difficult task.

And that’s why we will be sharing our curated list!

* Important documents (Passport, Offer letter, Proof of payment of tuition fees, Private insurance letter, Accommodation letter)
* Clothes (Sweater, Jacket, Pants, Fancy & Casual shirts, Shoes, Windbreaker, Umbrella, Grocery bag, Hat)
* Tech Gadgets (Phone, Laptop, Camera, Charger, Power bank, Headphones)
* Others (Thermos, Bottles, Skin care products, Cosmetics, Contact lenses, Glasses, Instant noodles, Food pastes, Medicine, Stationery, Face masks)

> Try to bring things which you can’t get in Ireland (Spices, Milo, etc.). Always bring some extra cash, since it takes a few weeks before you can get access to your new bank account!

## **Things to do after arriving in Ireland**

There are some things to do after arriving in Ireland which include:

#### Check your accommodation

* Electricity (Metered or Top-up)
* Hot water
* Central Hearing
* Lockable doors and windows

> Make sure the accommodation is in good condition (otherwise, take photos and notify the owner/person in charge.)

#### Get a mobile sim card

There are plenty of choices of sim card providers in Ireland such as Tesco Three and Vodafone. Typical pre-paid plans range from 10 - 20 euros a month. Unlimited data plan is best as it is cheap and there is unlimited data so you don’t have to spend money on Wifi.

### Grocery and essentials shopping

You should buy essentials such as shampoo, duvet, pillows, foods, cutlery, toilet paper.

> Supermarkets and stores in Ireland usually close early so be sure to get everything before they close!

### Apply for a bank account

Application of a personal bank account is important as it is not safe to keep so much cash at home. Also, you will need at least 3000 euros in the bank account before applying for a IRP card and therefore you should apply for this as soon as possible.

The common banks in Ireland include the Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and Bank of Ireland (BOI). An Irish phone number and address is also needed to open a bank account.

You should also apply for a student account as this helps avail of certain fees.

### Make an appointment for IRP card

IRP card applications must be submitted within three months of your arrival in Ireland. All students living in Dublin must make an appointment with the Burgh Quay Registration Office via their [appointment booking website](https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie/). If residing outside of Dublin, an appointment can be made by sending an email to the immigration office of your county.

You will need to bring your passport, proof of address, letter given by college, insurance receipt, bank slip to prove that there is at least **3000 euros** in your bank account. Bring your debit card as you will need to pay for 300 euros for the IRP application. The IRP card application is free of charge if you are under 18 years old.

If you have further enquiries about the IRP card application process, you should contact the Student Ambassador of your college or the International Office. For more information, please visit the [INIS website](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/first-time-registration).

### Working permit (PPS Number)
