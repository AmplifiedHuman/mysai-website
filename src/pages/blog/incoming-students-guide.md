2. Not fully vaccinated Malaysians must present a negative RT-PCR test result taken within 72 hours prior to arrival into Ireland.
3. The Sinovac vaccine offered in Malaysia is **NOT** approved in Ireland (does not count as fully vaccinated, and hence a PCR test is required).

## **Things to do after arriving in Ireland**

#### Greet & Transfer Service

A national ‘Greet & Transfer’ service for international students will be running at Dublin Airport from the 1st August. There will be dedicated ‘Greet & Transfer’ desks in the airport arrival halls. The welcome teams will greet you and coordinate your transport to your desired destination. This is a free service, but _you must complete your Greet and Transfer Booking Form_ **BEFORE** travelling. You should have received this form from your higher education Institution, otherwise you should contact your HEI directly.

There are also some things to do after arriving in Ireland which include:

#### Check your accommodation

* Electricity (Metered or Top-up)
* Hot water
* Central Heating
* Lockable doors and windows

> Make sure the accommodation is in good condition (otherwise, take photos and notify the owner/person in charge.)

#### Get a mobile sim card

There are plenty of choices of sim card providers in Ireland such as Tesco Three and Vodafone. Typical pre-paid plans range from 10 - 20 euros a month. Unlimited data plan is best as it is cheap and there is unlimited data so you don’t have to spend money on Wifi.

### Grocery and essentials shopping

You should buy essentials such as shampoo, duvet, pillows, foods, cutlery, toilet paper.

> Supermarkets and stores in Ireland usually close early so be sure to get everything before they close!

### Apply for a bank account

Application of a personal bank account is important as it is not safe to keep so much cash at home. Also, you will need at least 3000 euros in the bank account before applying for a IRP card and therefore you should apply for this as soon as possible.
