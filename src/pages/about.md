### What is MYSAI

The Malaysian Student Association of Ireland (MYSAI) a national student organisation based in Ireland set up to provide welfare for the Malaysian student community. We are a diverse yet united team of passionate and driven Malaysian students coming from 14 different institutions/universities all over Ireland with various academic backgrounds.

MYSAI was established around April 2019 and registered under Malaysian Government (Education Malaysia) in July 2019. Thus we are a registered society with the Malaysian Registrar of Societies. Since our establishment, we have formed links with international offices and student bodies which enable us to reach out to at least 600 students all across Ireland.

We believe that building up a community is the key to the empowerment of our students therefore it is MYSAI’s aim to unite Malaysian students under our umbrella organisation, establishing a safe space which students can provide mutual support and seek help in times of need. Within our association, we also made it our goal to develop leadership skills and technical intellect which could improve career prospects. Consisting of up to 40 committee members, MYSAI holds frequent welfare related events aiming to enhance Malaysian students’ experience of studying in Ireland both intellectually and ethically.
